### Part 2: Data Wrangling and visualization

```{r}
thanksgiving_meals <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-11-20/thanksgiving_meals.csv")
```

### Q1: First rows of thanksgiving_meals

```{r}
thanksgiving_meals %>% 
  head(10)%>%
  kable()
```

### Q2: Create a factor variable by using 'fct_reorder' and 'parse_number'

```{r}
thanksgiving_meals %>%
  mutate(family_income=fct_reorder(family_income, parse_number(family_income))) %>%
  kable()
```

### Q3: General statistics of thanksgiving_meals

### By using 'summary()'

```{r}
thanksgiving_meals %>% 
  summary()%>%
  kable()
```

### By using 'skim()'

```{r}
thanksgiving_meals %>%
  skim() %>%
  kable()
```

### Q4: Calculate the total number of people who celebrated thanksgiving

```{r}
thanksgiving_meals %>% 
  filter(celebrate=="Yes") %>%
  count() %>%
  kable()
```

### Q5: Calculate number of people who celebrated thanksgiving and had meals for main dish served (main_dish and main_prep)

```{r}
thanksgiving_meals%>%
  filter(celebrate!='No')%>%
  count(main_dish, main_prep,sort=TRUE)%>%
  kable()
```

### Q6: Data visualization represent the number of people who celebrated thanksgiving and had meals (main_dish againts main_prep)

```{r}
thanksgiving_meals %>%
  filter(celebrate!='No')%>%
  count(main_dish, main_prep, sort=TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n,main_dish,fill=factor(main_prep))) +  
  geom_col(position='stack',alpha=1) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw()
```

### Q7: Total number of cranberry used and total number of gravy used

### Total number of Cranberry Used

```{r}
thanksgiving_meals %>% 
  filter(cranberry!='None') %>%
   count() %>%
  kable()
```

### Total number of gravy Used

```{r}
thanksgiving_meals %>% 
  filter(gravy == 'Yes') %>%
   count() %>%
  kable()
```

### Q8: Number of people who celebrated thanksgiving according their range of family income.

```{r}
thanksgiving_meals %>%
  count(celebrate,family_income,sort=TRUE) %>%
  filter(celebrate == 'Yes') %>%
  group_by(family_income)%>%
  kable()
```

### Q9: Data Visualization represent the number of people who celebrated thanksgiving againts their range of family income.

```{r}
thanksgiving_meals %>%
  count(celebrate,family_income,sort=TRUE) %>%
  filter(celebrate == 'Yes') %>%
  group_by(family_income) %>%
  ggplot(aes(family_income,n,fill=celebrate)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x="Range of family income", y="Number of people who celebrated thanksgiving") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Q10: The most common type and number of pies, sides and desserts

### The most common type and number for pies 

```{r}
most_common_pie<- thanksgiving_meals %>%
  select(starts_with("pie"),-pie13) %>%
  gather(type, value,na.rm=TRUE) %>%
  count(type,value, sort = TRUE) %>%
  select(value, n) %>%
  head(1)
```

### The most common type and number for sides

```{r}
most_common_side<-thanksgiving_meals %>%
  select(starts_with("side"),-side15) %>%
  gather(type, value,na.rm=TRUE) %>%
  count(type,value, sort = TRUE) %>%
  select(value, n)%>%
  head(1)
```

### The most common type and number for desserts

```{r}
most_common_dessert<-thanksgiving_meals%>%
  select(starts_with("dessert"),-dessert11) %>%
  gather(type, value,na.rm=TRUE) %>%
  count(type,value, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(value!="None") %>%
  select(value, n) %>%
  head(1)
```

### Q11: Data Visualization for the most common types and number of pies, sides and desserts

```{r}
combined_most_Common<-rbind(most_common_pie ,most_common_side ,most_common_dessert)

combined_most_Common%>%
  ggplot(aes(value,n,fill=value)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_discrete(name= "Dishes", labels = c("dessert", "side", "pie"))+
  labs(title= "Most common type and number for pies, side and desserts", x="Most Common of dishes", y="Number of most common dishes") +
  theme_classic()
```

### Q12: Calculate the number of main_dish depends on the people who celebrated thanksgiving in different range of family income

```{r}
thanksgiving_meals %>%
  filter(celebrate == "Yes") %>%
  select(family_income,main_dish)%>%
  count(family_income,main_dish)%>%
  kable()
```

### Q13: Data visualization for the number of main_dish depends on the people who celebrated thanksgiving in different range of family income

```{r}
thanksgiving_meals %>%
  filter(celebrate == 'Yes') %>%
